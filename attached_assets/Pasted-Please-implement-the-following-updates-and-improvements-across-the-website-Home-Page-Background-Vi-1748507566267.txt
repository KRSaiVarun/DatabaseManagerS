Please implement the following updates and improvements across the website:

Home Page Background Video Issue

Resolve the connection problem with the background video on the homepage to ensure it loads and plays smoothly for all users.
Add "My Bookings" Tab in Sidebar

Introduce a new "My Bookings" tab in the sidebar menu.
When users click this tab, display their active bookings and canceled bookings separately.
Ensure this section is accessible only after user login.
Input Validation

Implement strict input validation on all relevant pages:
Login and Signup Pages:
Prevent entries with special characters, numbers, or invalid data in fields like username, email, and password.
Display appropriate error messages if validation fails, and disable form submission until inputs are valid.
Booking Page & Other Forms:
Add validation to prevent invalid inputs such as special characters or numbers in name fields or other text inputs.
Provide real-time feedback to users for invalid inputs.
Admin Route Management

When an admin logs in and attempts to add a route with details that already exist:
Do not add the duplicate route.
Display a message: "Route already exists."
Fix All Runtime Errors

Review and fix all runtime errors present across every page to ensure smooth functionality and user experience.
Payment Page Enhancements

When a user selects the UPI option:
Display the QR code for payment directly on the same page.
After the user scans the QR code and completes the payment:
Show a booking confirmation summary with all relevant details.
User Profile Management

When a user clicks the "Profile" option:
Navigate to a profile information page.
Allow the user to edit their profile details (e.g., username and email).
Apply changes immediately after the user clicks the "Edit" or "Save" button.
Booking Cancellation

When a user cancels a booking:
Mark the booking as canceled.
Reflect this change in the "My Bookings" tab.
Also, update the "Cancelled" bookings section in the admin dashboard when the admin clicks on the "Cancelled" button.
Remove "Book Flight" Tab

Remove the "Book Flight" option from the sidebar menu.
Default User Details in Booking

When a user logs in or signs up:
Use their details as defaults in the helipad booking form.
When selecting the number of passengers (1,2,3,4,5):
Prompt for passenger names and emails for each passenger, except for the default (logged-in user).
Consider 1 passenger as the default logged-in user, so no need for additional info for that passenger.
